// zones.js - ALL zone maps live here. To add a zone, copy a block and give it a new id.
// Every row of a zone must be the SAME length. Markers (P spawn, N npc, I item) become floor when parsed.
//
// Tiles shared by all zones:
//   #  wall (solid)        R  railing (solid)      .  open floor (grey stone paving, see floor.js)
//   a  blue recycling bin (solid)   o  red non-recyclable bin (solid)  - zone 1, side by side above the left end of the escalator rail
//   c  steel-blue pillar on a concrete plinth (solid) - zone 1: two rows (9 and 21), 6 tiles above / below the escalator
//   p  old "path" tile (walkable). Zone 1 no longer uses it; in other zones it now just looks like the stone floor
//   X  exit path           U  "up" path            S  stairs            D  store room door (solid)
//   L  lift (solid)        E/F escalators (solid, animated)             v  escalator well (solid)
//   W  raised glass skylight (solid, see-through to the floor below)
//   1-6    amphitheatre sitting tiers (solid), 1 = lowest step, 6 = highest - zone 1 upper section; corners are rounded where a block sticks out
//   q      semi-wall (solid): low board-formed concrete planter wall around the zone 1 hedge beds
//   m      flat base slab (solid): the one straight tile at the foot of each outer tier block (zone 1) - same look as the semi-wall; the stepped layers start on the row above it
//   7, 8   extra-high tiers (same as 1-6, just higher): they let every column of an outer tier block step down on the SAME rows
// New in zone 4:
//   C  concrete bench (solid)   T  tree in a grey planter box (solid)   b  bush (WALKABLE - you can walk into it)
// Planted areas with a pale guard rail (all solid; the rail is drawn automatically on every edge that faces open floor):
//   H  clipped hedge    Y  bush mound    Z  tree     (mix them freely, e.g. HHYHZHHY)
// Gymnasium (zone 1, left wall, rows 24-27):
//   J  gym sliding glass door (solid)   Q  wall with the usage-rules poster + wooden cabinet (solid)   r  red gym mat (walkable, 3 tiles between the two doors)
//   H  dense hedge (SOLID - a bush you can NOT walk through; used for the hedge lanes in zone 1)
// New in zone 3:
//   g  grass (walkable lawn)   K  storage room block (solid)   S on the bottom row = stairs down to zone 1
// New in zone 2:
//   B  pool rim (solid)    ~  water (solid)        M  men's restroom door (solid)   G  women's restroom door (solid)

export const ZONES = {
  // Zone 1 is 38 tiles wide and 30 tall.
  // UPPER SECTION (rows 0-6): an amphitheatre copied from the real rooftop. Hedge beds run all the way to the top edge (they are part of the lawn above).
  //   x1 walkway (the only up-path) | x2 semi-wall (q) | x3-4 left hedge | x5-16 amphitheatre | x17-19 right hedge | x20 semi-wall (q)
  //   x21-23 open in front of the storage room (grey block, DOOR in the middle at x22, grey block on each side; row 0) | x24-26 hedge bed
  //   Semi-wall (q): x2 and x20 run from row 0 down to row 6, and row 6 (x2-4, x17-20) closes the front of each hedge bed (hedges: rows 0-5).
  //   The outer tier blocks (x5-7, x14-16) end on row 6 with a flat base slab (m) so the wall and the steps share one straight front edge.
  //   Amphitheatre: tiers 1-6 are the big sitting steps (1 = lowest, 6 = highest). A tile's level = how many columns it is from the
  //   pit / flight + how many rows it is below row 5 (capped at 6), so the steps climb both outwards and towards the lawn.
  //   The pit is open to the south. Two small railed flights (S, x8-9 and x12-13, rows 0-4) climb from the back of the pit to the lawn;
  //   the handrail between the two lanes of each flight is solid (see map.js buildThinWalls). The block between the flights (x10-11)
  //   ends in a rounded tip on row 4, level with the bottom of the flights.
  // Pillars (c): rows 9 and 21, x = 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 and 28 (the hedge bed's left end). The row skips the skylight (x 21-26).
  // NOTE: all the stone paths (p) were removed from this zone - it is now one open stone floor. Exits (X / U / S) are unchanged.
  // The path notes below (x 7-8 path, x 27-28 walkway, 'path p' gaps...) still describe WHERE those lanes were, but they are plain floor now.
  //   - rows 9-20 (middle): the glass skylight (x 21-26) and the fenced bush bed (x 29-37) have the same height,
  //     so they sit side by side in the vertical middle of the map
  //   - rows 13-17 (left): escalator + lifts + the student. Exits to the pool zone are at x 0, rows 11 and 19
  //   - x 7-8: a stone path runs from the top paths down to the escalator landing
  //   - x 27-28: 2-tile walkway that runs the full height, between the glass and the right section
  //   - top sitting area (rows 1-7) and bottom sitting area (rows 22-28): a bench ring C around two trees T,
  //     walled off on the left by a 2-wide, 5-row hedge lane H. You enter through the 2-row gap (path p)
  //     between the hedge lane and the bush bed's railing (top: rows 6-7, bottom: rows 22-23)
  //   - x 22-26, rows 0-5: a small mixed hedge (H/Y/Z) right of the storage room. It has no rail on top, so it looks like
  //     it keeps going into the upper zone. The 2-wide path beside it (x 27-28, rows 0-7) will lead up to that zone
  //   - rows 21-23 on the left: open south area (the lost ID card lives here, at x 14, row 22)
  //   - rows 24-28, x 1-26: the long mixed hedge strip (H / Y / Z). The 2-wide walkway (x 27-28) runs along its right end
  //   - gymnasium: on the left wall (x 0, rows 24-27) with a 2-wide path (x 1-2, rows 24-28; the red mat covers x 1, rows 24-26, between the two doors) cut through
  //     the hedge strip. The opening at (0,28) will later connect to the pool zone
  //   - rows 8-21, x 29-36: the planted bed (same H / Y / Z mix), wall on x 37
