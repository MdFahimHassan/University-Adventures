# University Adventures

A cozy top-down 2D pixel-art adventure inspired by a real university rooftop. No combat, no monsters: just exploring, talking to students and helping out.

> **Status:** early prototype (v0.1). One small map, one NPC, one quest.

## The story so far

You arrive on the rooftop by escalator, fading in from the floor below. A student near the elevators has lost their ID card. Find it on the lawn and bring it back.

## Features

- **Opening cutscene:** an animated escalator ride with a fade-in from black (press `E` or `Space` to skip)
- **Smooth movement:** 4-direction walking with a sprite walk cycle, using delta time so speed is the same on every monitor
- **Tile-based collision:** walls, water and hedges block you, and you slide along them
- **Follow camera:** centers on the player and stops at the map edges
- **NPC with dialogue:** talk to a student, who turns to face you
- **Mini quest system:** a small state machine with an on-screen quest tracker
- **Text-based maps:** edit the world by changing characters in `js/map.js`
- **Debug mode:** press `F3` to see the tile grid, solid tiles and collision boxes

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `W` `A` `S` `D` / Arrow keys | Move |
| `E` | Talk / advance dialogue |
| `E` / `Space` | Skip the intro |
| `F3` | Toggle debug view |
| `C` | Show or hide credits |

## Running the game

The game uses ES modules, which browsers block when you open `index.html` directly from disk. Use a local server:

```bash
cd rooftop-game
python -m http.server 8000      # on Windows you can also use: py -m http.server 8000
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

If you use VS Code, the *Live Server* extension also works. After editing code, hard-refresh with `Ctrl + Shift + R` to bypass the cache.

## Tech

- HTML5 Canvas 2D with a `requestAnimationFrame` game loop
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules)
- No frameworks, engines, libraries or build tools

### Editing the map

The map is a grid of characters in `js/map.js`. Every row must be the same length.

| Char | Tile |
|---|---|
| `#` | Wall / railing |
| `.` | Stone floor |
| `~` | Water |
| `h` | Hedge / planter |
| `g` | Grass |
| `E` / `r` | Escalator belt / rail |
| `P` / `N` / `I` | Player spawn / NPC / item |

## Roadmap

- [ ] More zones: garden corner, overlook, covered area, amphitheater
- [ ] Locked gym door and follow-up quests
- [ ] NPC collision and more NPCs
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] Save and load progress
- [ ] Mobile touch controls
- [ ] Title screen and menu
